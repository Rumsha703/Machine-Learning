# 🌳 Decision Trees & 🌲 Random Forests in Python

This project focuses on implementing **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** algorithms for classification tasks using Python. It includes model building, visualization, and performance evaluation on real-world data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze a dataset using two powerful tree-based machine learning algorithms:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

...and compare their performance in predicting the target variable.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- A labeled dataset is used, likely involving classification tasks (e.g., user behavior, survival, or purchase prediction).
- Dataset features include both **numerical** and **categorical** variables.
- If your dataset is from `Social_Network_Ads.csv` or `Titanic.csv`, feel free to specify.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data handling
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – ML models and evaluation

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Decision Tree**: A flowchart-like structure for making decisions based on input features.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned missing data
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Scaled features (if necessary)

2. **Model Implementation**
   - Trained a Decision Tree using `DecisionTreeClassifier`
   - Trained a Random Forest using `RandomForestClassifier`

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
   - Feature importance
   - Cross-validation (optional)

4. **Visualization**
   - Decision boundary plots
   - Feature importance bar charts
   - Tree diagram (optional via `plot_tree()`)

---

## ✅ Results

- **Random Forest** generally provided higher accuracy and better generalization than the single Decision Tree.
- Feature importance plots highlighted the most influential features.
- The model predictions aligned well with actual classes on the test set.
