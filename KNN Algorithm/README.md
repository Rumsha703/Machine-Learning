# 📍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classification using a real-world dataset. The goal is to predict target classes based on the nearest training samples in the feature space.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To apply the **KNN algorithm** to a classification problem and evaluate its performance using different values of **k (number of neighbors)**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset used (likely from `sklearn.datasets` or an uploaded CSV) includes labeled features appropriate for classification.
- Common examples include **Iris**, **Breast Cancer**, or **custom CSVs**.
- If using a specific dataset (e.g., "Social_Network_Ads.csv"), you can update the dataset name in this section.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numeric processing
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning & model selection

## 🧠 What is KNN?

K-Nearest Neighbors is a **lazy learning**, **instance-based** supervised algorithm. It classifies data points by comparing them with the **k** most similar instances (neighbors) in the training dataset.

---

## 📌 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the dataset
   - Handled missing values and normalized data (if needed)
   - Encoded categorical variables (if present)

2. **Model Building**
   - Used `KNeighborsClassifier` from `sklearn`
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Tested different `k` values to observe performance variation

3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
   - Visual plots for decision boundaries (if included)

---

## ✅ Results

- The model achieved solid performance at optimal `k` values.
- Lower values of `k` may lead to overfitting, while higher values can underfit.
- KNN is sensitive to **feature scaling**, so preprocessing steps like **standardization** improved results.
