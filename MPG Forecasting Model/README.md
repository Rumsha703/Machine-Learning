# 🚗 MPG Forecasting Model

## 📝 Description
This project involves building and evaluating a machine learning model to forecast **Miles Per Gallon (MPG)** for different cars using various vehicle attributes. The aim is to predict fuel efficiency based on features such as displacement, horsepower, weight, and more.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Auto MPG dataset)
- **Features Used**:
  - Cylinders
  - Displacement
  - Horsepower
  - Weight
  - Acceleration
  - Model Year
  - Origin
- **Target Variable**: MPG (Miles per Gallon)

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for modeling and evaluation)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Linear Regression**
- Model Evaluation Metrics:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 📈 Outcomes
- Successfully trained a **Linear Regression model** to forecast MPG.
- Achieved reasonable accuracy with:
  - **R² Score**: ~0.80
  - **MAE**: ~2.1 MPG
- Visualized:
  - Distribution of MPG
  - Relationships between features and MPG
  - Actual vs. Predicted MPG comparison plot
